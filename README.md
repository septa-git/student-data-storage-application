# How to Build a Simple and Secure Web Application for Student Data Management Using Node.js, Express.js, and JSON

Student Data Storage Application is a web-based application that allows users to store, retrieve, and manipulate data of students using the Node.js and Express.js technologies. The application uses a local JSON file as the data storage and does not require any object data modeling (ODM) tool. The application follows the RESTful API design principles and uses JSON as the data format. The application is built using the Express generator and implements authentication, authorization, validation, and error handling. The application is designed to be fast, efficient, and secure.
